port module Api exposing (Cred, addServerError, application, decodeErrors, delete, get, login, logout, post, put, register, settings, storageDecoder, storeCredWith, username, viewerChanges)

{-| This module is responsible for communicating to the Conduit API.

It exposes an opaque Endpoint type which is guaranteed to point to the correct URL.

import Api.Endpoint as Endpoint exposing (Endpoint)
import Avatar exposing (Avatar)

import Browser.Navigation as Nav
import Http exposing (Body, Expect)

-- CRED


{-| The authentication credentials for the Viewer (that is, the currently logged-in user.)

This includes:

  - The cred's Username
  - The cred's authentication token

By design, there is no way to access the token directly as a String.
It can be encoded for persistence, and it can be added to a header
to a HttpBuilder for a request, but that's it.

This token should never be rendered to the end user, and with this API, it
can't be!

username : Cred -> Username
username (Cred val _) =
    val


credHeader : Cred -> Http.Header
credHeader (Cred _ str) =
    Http.header "authorization" ("Token " ++ str)


{-| It's important that this is never exposed!

We expose `login` and `application` instead, so we can be certain that if anyone
ever has access to a `Cred` value, it came from either the login API endpoint
or was passed in via flags.
