ðŸ‘‰ I gave [a talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1FU3e0sT1I)
to explain the principles I used to build this. I highly recommend watching it!

> [Elm](http://elm-lang.org) codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld-example-apps) spec and API.


### [Demo](https://elm-spa-example.netlify.com/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with [Elm](http://elm-lang.org) including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

For more information on how this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.
